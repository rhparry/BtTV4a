# BtTV-4a: Bemisia tabaci toursvirus 4a

This repository contains supplementary data for the manuscript "Bemisia tabaci toursvirus (BtTV-4a), a ubiquitous dsDNA virus in African and North American whiteflies, expands the toursviruses to Hemipterans."

## Overview

BtTV-4a is the first toursvirus identified in a hemipteran insect. This discovery significantly expands our understanding of ascovirus host range and evolution. The genome represents a large circular viral DNA sequence of 186,646 bp containing 200 predicted open reading frames (ORFs).

## Genome Information

- **GC content**: 32.3%
- **Number of ORFs**: 200
- **Raw sequencing data**: Available at NCBI SRA under BioProject ID PRJNA418329

## Supplementary Files

### Supplementary File 1: BtTV-4a protein annotation
Complete annotation of the 200 predicted ORFs in the BtTV-4a genome, including protein domains and functional predictions based on Pfam and Conserved Domain Database analyses.

### Supplementary File 2: Protein sequences for phylogeny
The sequences of ten conserved viral proteins from representatives of Ascoviridae and Iridoviridae families used in the phylogenetic analysis.

### Supplementary File 3: Unaligned protein sequences
Raw protein sequences of conserved genes from representative viruses before multiple sequence alignment, used for phylogenetic analyses.

### Supplementary File 4: MAFFT aligned sequences
Multiple sequence alignments of conserved viral proteins used for phylogenetic tree construction. These alignments were generated using MAFFT and used as input for IQ-TREE2.

### Supplementary File 5: Orthogroup annotation
Orthologous cluster analysis results showing shared gene families between BtTV-4a and other Ascoviridae members, generated using OrthoFinder.
